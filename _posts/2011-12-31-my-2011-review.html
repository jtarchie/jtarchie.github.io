<p>I'm throwing my hat into the "year in review" ring.</p>
<p>I started my year off with a recovery from a running related injury. Coming off my natural high of running a marathon. I decided my 2010 year would end with a 50km run through the Marine Headlands of San Francisco. My training was tough, so much so that 3 weeks into, I could hardly bend my knees without pain. All my muscles and tendons were tight.</p>
<p>The recovery was slow, but eventually I got back on my feet and running. My concentration became more on speed than distance. I had to learn to do things right before doing the extreme. My goal of 50km still awaits me.</p>
<p>In May, running took me through one of my greatest challenges. I and 11 other friend-runners (frienners?), with 2 vans stockpiled with food, Gatorade, and running gear, set out to cross 198 miles over a 2-day relay race. It was awesome. I can not do</p>
<p>No sleep, running at 1am through quiet back streets, and ending in the beautiful cliff side with panoramic Pacific views. I'm coming back for it next year!</p>

<p>I've also been grateful this year for the friends that I have and made. One of the greatest friendships I have forged has been through a common interest with my video podcast called <a href="http://yetanotherbeershow.com" target="_blank">Yet Another Beer Show</a>. I've been able to work with Colin and Steve on with one of my greatest interests -- beer. We've had obstacles in our way, but I feel that 2011 is the return of Yet Another Beer Show. We'll be back!</p>
<p>I've also seen my friends get hitched! Now I've question their intentions, mainly asking why, and sometimes being the voice of reason to say "It's not too late to run. The keys are in the car." All joking aside, I've seen my friends who are happy being with each other decide to complete their lives. This is the single greatest thing I've seen in my friends and because of it have had the experience to visit some awesome locales for weddings. This year I actually have Best Man duties to my best friend's wedding, which will be tame and completely uninteresting.</p>

<p>This year takes me, once again, of having to pay taxes in two difference cities, in two different states. I've dealt with this many times before as this is not the first time I have picked up everything and move to a city.</p>
<p>My move to New York City from San Francisco was two-year itch. A change in scenery and people is always what leads my itch. I have this avoidance to settling on anything. New York has proven to me that there something that can satisfy my need for impulse activities.</p>
<p>At seven months now, starting at the end of May, I've seen, met, and done a lot in New York City.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_28" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Sunset over South Williamsburg as seen from my apartment"]<a href="http://jtarchie.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/298399_10100143467841197_10603565_46249305_1508901001_n.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-28" title="Sunset over South Williamsburg" src="http://jtarchie.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/298399_10100143467841197_10603565_46249305_1508901001_n.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>New York has proven to be the city that everyone I know wants to come a visit, which has been awesome! To anyone reading this, come visit, let's play tourist.</p>
<p>New York is also a host to a lot of people who I have met through the years. Its been a constant reminder of how small the world can be. With well over 8 million people, its amazing how much I run into the people at the gym, in the neighborhood, or subway who I haven't seen in years.</p>
<p>The most memorable of the reunions was my 10 year high school reunion. These are people who I grew up with in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_29" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="10 year High School Reunion of HKIS class 2001"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-29 " title="10 year High School Reunion" src="http://jtarchie.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/286058_10150322061090399_587150398_9717736_1412964_o.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" />[/caption]</p>
<p>It's interesting to say 10 years, it's a long time, but when I met everyone again no time had passed for us. People got older, skinnier, fatter, better looking, matured, still haven't matured, etc, but overall it was the same diverse group of people I grew up. With all our changes and backgrounds, we still greet each as only a day has passed.</p>
<p>Is New York home? I love it here, but there's always more of the world to explore. I have that itch, the world as small and there is so much to do and see.</p>
<p>The year of 2011 was exciting, healing, and awesome! If you have been apart of it thanks, if you haven't, see you soon its been far too long.</p>
