<p>In my senior year of high school, it was required to get a medical checkup for college acceptance. The doctor did the normal gamut of tests -- hearing, sight, etc. At the very end, he sat me down and told me that I had a problem.</p>
<p>“If you don’t do something about your weight now, you have the potential to suffer from diabetes, heart problems, low energy, and so forth. You need to do something about this.”</p>
<p>Its not that I was morbidly obese, but unhealthy overweight at 230 pounds at 5 foot 11 inches (on a good day).</p>
<p>I had always known I was big, but the doctor put it into a perspective that no one else ever had for me. It would affect me even more later in life. At seventeen, your future is usually not your biggest concern, it became it for me.</p>
<p>I was set out to lose weight. I didn’t have a target goal. It was just to not be my current me.</p>
<p>As far as I can remember, I had always been the fat kid. It came with childhood teasing and nicknames of Beluga and fatty. I wore a size of shirts and pants that was much larger than anyone else in my grade. Picked last in every gym class team selection. As I said, the fat kid.</p>
<p>My grandmother use to call it my “baby weight” -- an excuse that didn’t make sense into my teens. I had other family members claim it was because I was big-boned -- a medical condition that seems to affect many. I had a big appetite and could just take in more than most people.</p>
<p>Excuses are what these were. A problem had been identified, but excuses were the solution.</p>
<p>The doctor was a reality check.</p>
<p>Within a two-month span, I changed my eating habits and got regular exercise. Anything with high sugar content had been removed. It became skinless chicken, vegetables, and fruits, with and strawberry-yogurt being treat. Pulled out the roller blades and found a path 2-3 times a week to go up and down. Didn’t measure the distance, just went till I was tired.</p>
<p>Before the end of my senior year, I got myself down to 175 pounds. My graduation photos look like a completely different person. I had an actual chin and, as my mom likes to point out, cheekbones.</p>
<p>I felt great. It was the first time in my life that felt I had confidence in myself.</p>
<p>I joined the speech club and felt comfortable talking in front of people.</p>
<p>I had three girls ask me to senior prom.</p>
