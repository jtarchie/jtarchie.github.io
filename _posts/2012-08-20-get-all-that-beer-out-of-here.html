<p>Over the past year, you may have noticed that I've been training for ultra-races -- a distance longer than a marathon. As part of my training regime, I stopped drinking. Not a single bottle of beer, glass of wine, mixed cocktail, or hard liquor crossed my lips from January until June.</p>
<p>It was hard.</p>
<p>A fundamental aspect of our social lives, especially in a big city, is centered around drinking. Everyone would go out, I'd follow along, and be the sober one. I was the funniest I'd ever been. It was a great time. And the next morning, I'd wake up and go for a run without feeling dehydrated or hungover.</p>
<p>My friends were very supportive and I cannot thank them enough for it. There were several times where I thought that one drink wouldn't hurt me, but they supported me in positive peer-pressure. Don't give up on your goal!</p>
<p>After my long run (50km), I started drinking again. Logic being my training was over, so I could resume my normal routine.</p>
<p>Do you know what happens when your body is deprived of something this is not life sustaining for a long time? You find out, you really don't need it.</p>
<p>I drank beer again, the nectar of the gods. For those who don't know, I use to run a beer podcast called <a href="http://yetanotherbeershow.com" target="_blank">Yet Another Beer Show</a>. My tolerance had dropped to the point where a beer would get me loaded. It just didn't taste the same for me again.</p>
<p>One night, a friend and I caught up with two bottles of wine. The second bottle tasted horrible, but we still ended up drinking it. The next day he was hungover, I was highly dehydrated, but forced myself to go for a run anyways. This is the day I started training for my 50-mile run.</p>
<p>I stopped drinking for this training, again.</p>
<p>Two months into it, I've decided to make another change, I've quit drinking. I'm done. This shouldn't be hard as I've done it for a majority of this year.</p>
<p>Some of my friends have already called me crazy. I'm aware that this has impacted my social life. People have stopped inviting me out to bars, whether this is conscious or subconscious remains to be seen.</p>
<p>A side effect has actually been more free time. What to do?</p>
<p>To this announcement, I have a my beer collection to give away. I've started <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuFTzWkt9MZudHk2RUJ0XzVOS2FManVTT09udF8tSnc" target="_blank">documenting everything</a>, but still need to complete the list. Let me know if you want something.</p>
